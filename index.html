<h3>About me</h3>

<p>I was born and raised in Puerto Rico, where friends and family usually call me
Emma. You're more than welcome to do the same!</p>

<p>I'm currently finishing up an internship at the University of Minnesota,
supervised by <a href="https://favonia.org">Favonia</a>. Before that, I was a
master's student at Penn. At Penn, I was fortunate enough to work with
<a href="https://seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich">Stephanie Weirich</a>, who is
an incredible mentor.</p>

<p>On a personal level, I have many interests: cats, running, video games,
climbing, cycling, food. I'm also passionate about diversity, equity, and
inclusion; I hope to contribute to building safe spaces and increasing
participation in research and academia.</p>
