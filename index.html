<div class="about">
<h3>About me</h3>

<p>I was born and raised in Puerto Rico, where friends and family usually call me
Emma. You're more than welcome to do the same!</p>

<p>This coming fall, I'll be starting a PhD at Cornell. Currently, I'm a
master's student at Penn. I've been fortunate to work with
<a href="https://seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich">Prof. Stephanie Weirich</a>, who has
been an incredible mentor.</p>

<p>On a personal level, I have many interests: cats, running, video games,
climbing, cycling, food. I'm also passionate about diversity, equity, and
inclusion; I hope to contribute to building safe spaces and increasing
participation in research and academia.</p>
