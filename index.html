<h3>About me</h3>

<p>I was born and raised in Puerto Rico, where friends and family usually call me
Emma. (You're more than welcome to do the same!) I'm a PhD student at Cornell,
supported by the Dean's Excellence and Hopper-Dean Fellowship as well as the NSF
Graduate Research Fellowship. My research interests are in programming languages
(their theory and semantics) as well as type theory.</p>

<p>This past summer, I worked with <a href="https://favonia.org">Favonia</a> as a
research intern, studying a type theory with strictly associative dependent sum
types. Prior to Cornell, I was a master's student at Penn. I was fortunate enough
to work with <a href="https://seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich">Stephanie Weirich</a>,
who was an incredible mentor. We worked on a few things together, like effects
and coeffects in call-by-push-value.</p>

<p>On a personal level, I have many interests: cats, running, video games,
climbing, cycling, food. I'm also passionate about diversity, equity, and
inclusion; I hope to contribute to building safe spaces and increasing
participation in research and academia.</p>
