<h3>About me</h3>

<p>I was born and raised in Puerto Rico, where friends and family usually call me
Emma. You're more than welcome to do the same! I'm currently a master's student
at Penn. I've been fortunate to work with
<a href="https://seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich">Prof. Stephanie Weirich</a>, who has
been an incredible mentor. Together, we've written a paper in literate Agda
about logical relations and studied effects and coeffects in
call-by-push-value.</p>

<p>On a personal level, I have many interests: cats, running, video games,
climbing, cycling, food. I'm also passionate about diversity, equity, and
inclusion; I hope to contribute to building safe spaces and increasing
participation in research and academia. I've benefitted greatly from the help
and advice of other students, and am happy to pay it forward. If you're going
through the grad school application process, feel free to reach out!</p>
