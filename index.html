<p>My name is Emmanuel, though most people call me Emma. I'm a second year master's student at the
Unviersity of Pennsylvania. My research interests are in the areas of programming languages, type
systems, and proof assistants.
</p>

<p>I'm very fortunate to work with <a href="https://seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich">Prof. Stephanie
Weirich</a>, who has been an incredible mentor. Together, we've written a paper in literate Agda
about logical relations and studied effects and coeffects in call-by-push-value (CBPV).</p>

<p>I'm planning to continue my studies as a PhD student starting in Fall 2024,
   and I'm currently going through the application process for several schools.
</p>

<h3>About me</h3>
<p>I was born and raised in Puerto Rico; I am more than happy to be contacted in Spanish. I am
   passionate about diversity, equity, and inclusion. This applies not only in academia (I hope to
   contribute to increasing participation and building safe spaces in STEM) but also more broadly
   in society as a whole.
</p>

<p>I have many hobbies: cats, running, video games, climbing, cycling, food. I love discovering that
I share a common interest with someone, though I am excited about most things.</p>
